# Hi 👋, I'm Saif Hassan 

Where developers focus on code, architecture, performance, and engineering, I would focus on the big picture of "what are we trying to do" and the user experience, the feature set, and the way the product will get used.

Lead Product Manager at weDevs, former PM at Poptin & Premio.

I'm a writer by day, a reader by night. I bring together a team and rally them around. My job is to tackle business problems and work with other teams to solve customer issues with unique and innovative solutions. I take raw technology and make something great out of it.

I serve as the coordinating point where all the disciplines come together - I am a hub that connects different teams, including designers, developers, testers, and marketers. \n  \n I build products that people love to use. I am obsessive about making the experience seamless and accessible for everyone in an intuitive way. I solve users' problems, and I think like users and develop innovative solutions to tackle those problems in a meaningful way.

I’m an advocate of Human-Centered Design and believe that websites and the tools used to build them should be well crafted, intuitive, and accessible.

Cyclist. Reader. A WordPress ninja 🥷, HCI expert & a design thinker 💡
